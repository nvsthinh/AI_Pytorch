# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 1. Overview
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful, supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between the data points of different classes. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are versatile due to different kernel functions.

## 2. Implementation
This implementation of SVM uses PyTorch to perform the necessary computations and optimizations.

### 2.1. Files
- `svm.py`: Contains the PyTorch implementation of Support Vector Machine.
