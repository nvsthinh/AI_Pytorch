# Softmax Regression

## 1. Overview
Softmax Regression, also known as Multinomial Logistic Regression, is a generalization of logistic regression to multiple classes. It is used when the target variable is categorical with more than two classes. The softmax function is used to calculate the probabilities of each class.

## 2. Implementation
This implementation of Softmax Regression uses PyTorch to perform gradient descent and optimize the weights.

### 2.1. Files
- `softmax_regression.py`: Contains the PyTorch implementation of Softmax Regression.
